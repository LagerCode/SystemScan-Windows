This is a gui application which is meant for checking hardware info, Os info, network info and actions such as checking the connection speed with speedtest and running a antivirus scan.
The program is a python application where tkinter is responsible for the gui and powershell for the info functions and the malwarescan.
The speedtest is done by calling the speedtest.exe file which is in the project folder.
This program works with python 3.8, may work with some earlier versions.
If the functions doesn't work, it may be cause of powershell rights since deafult is not to accept powershell scripts.


Things to improve: remove the curly brackets and the string "None" from the display window
